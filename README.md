Book Dataset Analysis

Overview
This repository contains code for analyzing a dataset of books, focusing on various aspects such as ratings, reviews, prices, genres, and authorship. The analysis includes data visualization using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to gain insights into trends and relationships within the dataset.
